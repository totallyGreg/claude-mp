❯ looking at @agentskill_scripting.md and the recent changes to the         
  @skills/skillsmith/references/python_uv_guide.md, is there a similar set  
  of guidance or tooling that can help with generating javascript code?     
  ⎿  Read agentskill_scripting.md (86 lines)
  ⎿  Read skills/skillsmith/references/python_uv_guide.md (344 lines)

⏺ Looking at both documents, I can see they're focused on Python's uv + PEP 723 pattern for fast, self-contained scripts. Let me search the codebase to see if there's existing guidance for JavaScript.

⏺ Search(pattern: "javascript|typescript|node|npm|deno|bun", path:
        "skills/skillsmith/references")
  ⎿  Found 5 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/references/*js*.md")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

⏺ Search(pattern: "(javascript|typescript|node|npm|deno)", path:
        "skills/skillsmith/references/agentskills_specification.md",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Based on my search, there isn't currently a JavaScript equivalent guide in the skillsmith references. However, there are several approaches in the JavaScript ecosystem that can achieve similar goals to uv + PEP 723:

  JavaScript Alternatives for Agent-Friendly Scripts

  1. Deno (Closest Match)

  Deno supports self-contained scripts with inline dependency management:

  #!/usr/bin/env -S deno run --allow-net --allow-read

  import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.208.0/http/server.ts";
  import { parse } from "https://deno.land/std@0.208.0/flags/mod.ts";

  // Script logic here

  Benefits:
  - Dependencies are URLs (no package.json needed)
  - Built-in caching
  - TypeScript support out of the box
  - Fast startup

  Execution: deno run script.ts (auto-caches on first run)

  2. npx (For Published Packages)

  npx cowsay "Hello from agent"

  Benefits:
  - Zero config for published tools
  - Automatic caching
  - One-line execution

  Limitations:
  - Only works for published packages
  - Can't use for custom scripts with inline deps

  3. Bun (Fast Runtime)

  Similar to Node but much faster:

  bun run script.js

  Benefits:
  - Extremely fast
  - Compatible with Node.js
  - Built-in bundler

  Limitations:
  - Still needs package.json for dependencies

  4. Single-File Node.js Scripts

  For scripts with no/minimal dependencies:

  #!/usr/bin/env node
  // Pure Node.js, no external deps
  const fs = require('fs');
  // ...

  Recommendation

  There's no exact PEP 723 equivalent for JavaScript, but for agent workflows:

  1. Use Deno if you need dependencies and want self-contained scripts
  2. Use npx for published CLI tools
  3. Use plain Node.js for dependency-free scripts
  4. Avoid package.json when possible to reduce complexity

  Would you like me to create a JavaScript/Deno guide similar to python_uv_guide.md that documents best practices for agent-friendly JavaScript scripts? This could cover:
  - Deno script patterns
  - When to use npx vs Deno vs Node
  - Inline dependency management strategies
  - Token-efficient execution patterns
