  - 'The CoSAI Risk Map categorizes AI development into four areas:'
  - - Data
    - Infrastructure
    - Model
    - Application
  - >
    This framing represents the broadened scope of AI development compared to traditional
    software development. In addition to the familiar code, infrastructure, and application
    components, AI introduces the complexities of data, training, and model development.
    Understanding how these dimensions work together is crucial to assessing the unique
    risks of AI development. The controls suggested to address the risks across this
    framing all align with the six core elements of Google's SAIF.

    title: Infrastructure components
    description:
      - >
        The data components of AI development depend on the infrastructure underpinning
        with secure hardware, resilient code, data storage, and development and deployment
        platforms. Risks to this infrastructure can affect model and framework code,
        model and data storage, and model serving.
      - >
        Attackers could try to poison, manipulate, or steal the data, models, or weights
        held in storage. If the model source code, dependencies, or any tools used
        to create and deploy them aren’t protected, attackers could tamper with them
        to create drastic changes to the model’s behavior, causing major security issues.
      - >
        The first step in securing these infrastructure components is to apply traditional
        security practices to the physical environments used for training, storage
        and serving. Host and network security is needed to restrict potential attackers.
        Authentication and authorization for any access to the physical environments
        is essential. Software supply chain integrity for all traditional software
        dependencies should be considered.

        title: Data components
        description:
          - >
            Traditional software development follows predictable instructions: the user
            inputs trigger static code, which determines the logic driving outcomes of the
            program. In AI development, data takes on aspects of the role previously played
            by code—which transforms the security and privacy risks.
          - >
            AI models are dynamic systems. They rely not only on their static code and user
            inputs, but also on learned patterns encoded in their internal parameters, referred
            to as 'model weights.' These weights are derived from the model's training
            data and training processes.
          - >
            Compromising these model weights can have a significant impact on the model's
            behavior and outputs. This makes attacks on model weights as potentially damaging
            as attacks targeting the code in traditional software development.

    title: Model components
    description:

        The central concept for AI-powered applications is the model. The purpose of
        a model is to apply the  statistical patterns extracted from training data
        and use these to generate new text, images, videos, or other output data (also
        known as inferences) from input data provided to it.

        title: Orchestration
        description:
          - >
            Beyond its core reasoning and planning capabilities, an agent relies on a 
            variety of external components to access information, process data, and 
            execute actions. This process is called orchestration because it involves 
            managing and coordinating a variety of independent services and data sources 
            to achieve a single, complex task. These resources provide the agent with its 
            memory, its ability to act in the physical world, and the specific knowledge 
            needed to complete tasks. Securing these external components is critical, 
            since they represent key interaction points that can be targeted by attackers 
            to manipulate the agent’s behavior.
  - id: componentsApplication
    title: Application components
    description:
      - >
        Users interact with AI models differently than with traditional algorithm-based
        searches and services. Some AI models act in response to more natural user
        prompting, with wording and phrasing choices directly affecting how an LLM,
        for example, infers requests, actions, and intent. When compared to interactions
        processed through an API, this more direct interaction introduces new avenues
        of risk, such as prompt injection.
      - >
        Additionally, Generative AI models are increasingly used as agents or assistants
        that can act on a user’s behalf to provide helpful functions. In these situations,
        AI models are interacting with other systems to get information or run specialized
        computational functions, including state-changing actions. While this networking
        opens up exciting possibilities of more complex behaviors, each connection
        also increases the potential impact of a successful attack on the AI model
        or network.

        required to run inferences (i.e., make predictions) when the model is in use.
        Usually framework code is shipped separately from the model itself and needs
        to be installed to use the model.

    title: Agent Reasoning Core
    description:
      - >
        The core of an agent’s functionality is its ability to reason about a user’s goal
        and create a plan to achieve it. The reasoning core processes system instructions,
        user queries, and contextual information to generate a sequence of actions. The 
        actions, or tool calls, allow the agent to affect the real world—interacting with 
        external systems, retrieving new information, or making changes to data and resources.

        The reasoning core typically consists of one or more models—possibly separate 
        models for the reasoning and then planning steps, or potentially one large model 
        able to do both. The process of planning is often iterative, taking place in a 
        “reasoning loop” where the plan is refined based on new information or the results 
        of previous actions. This iterative nature, combined with the ingestion of 
        external data, creates a vulnerability to indirect prompt injection, where 
        adversarially crafted information can manipulate the agent's planning process.

        The complexity of plans determines the agent’s level of autonomy, which can 
        range from selecting a predefined workflow to dynamically orchestrating 
        multi-step actions. This level of autonomy directly governs the potential 
        severity of a security failure—the more an agent can do on its own, the greater 
        the risk from manipulation or misalignment. This risk can be, at least partially, 
        mitigated through guardrails that constrain actions taken by an agent; for 
        example, by making certain actions subject to mandatory user confirmation. 
        However, this can in turn result in limitations on the agent's autonomy, thus 
        requiring a careful tradeoff between autonomy and security.

    description:

        An agent’s interaction with the world begins at the User or Application, which 
        serves as the interface for collecting both explicit user instructions and passively 
        collected contextual data from its environment. This blend of inputs creates a 
        primary security challenge of reliably distinguishing trusted commands from the 
        controlling user versus potentially untrusted information from other sources. 
        An agent application processes explicit user instructions, which can be given 
        directly (synchronously) like a typed command, or be configured to execute 
        automatically when a specific event occurs (asynchronously). It also gathers 
        implicit contextual inputs—data that isn’t a direct command but is passively 
        collected from the environment, such as sensor readings, application state, tool
        call responses or the content of recently opened documents.

        Input Handling is is responsible for processing and understanding these inputs 
        before they are sent to the agent’s reasoning core. This handoff is a critical 
        security juncture, as the perception layer must reliably distinguish trusted user 
        commands from untrusted data to prevent manipulation of the agent’s core logic.

        The final step in an agent’s workflow is response rendering, the process or 
        formatting of an AI agent’s generated output for display and interaction within a 
        user application. This stage is a critical security boundary because it involves 
        taking dynamic content from the agent and displaying it within the trusted context 
        of a user’s application, such as a web browser or mobile application. Flaws in 
        this process can allow malicious content generated by a compromised agent to be 
        executed by the application, leading to significant security breaches.

        Agents often produce content in a universal format like Markdown, which is then 
        interpreted and rendered by the specific client application. If this output isn’t 
        properly sanitized according to the content type, it can create severe 
        vulnerabilities. For example, unsanitized output can enable data exfiltration when 
        content-embedded resources like images are automatically loaded by the 
        application, implicitly passing sensitive information to an attacker's server via 
        the resource's URL. Similarly, improper sanitization can lead to cross-site 
        scripting (XSS) attacks.
