# Record Organization for Therapist Sole Proprietors

This reference provides frameworks for organizing business records by category and managing retention.

## Why Record Organization Matters

Good record organization:
- Supports accurate tax deduction claims (receipts prove business expenses)
- Enables quick response to IRS inquiries or audits
- Makes tax filing faster and cheaper (less time for CPA to organize records)
- Helps you spot over- or under-deducting throughout the year
- Provides documentation for license renewal (CE records, compliance documentation)

Poor record organization often leads to:
- Missing deductions (forgot to deduct valid expenses)
- Audit risk (no receipts to support claimed deductions)
- Higher CPA fees (they spend time organizing what you didn't)
- Missed license renewal deadlines (lost CE certificates)

## Overall File Structure

### Recommended Organization

Create a folder structure like this on your computer or in cloud storage (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox):

```
Business Records/
├── 2026/
│   ├── Tax & Accounting/
│   │   ├── Estimated Quarterly Payments/
│   │   ├── Income Documentation/
│   │   └── Year-End Tax Files/
│   ├── Expenses/
│   │   ├── Office & Workspace/

```

### Use Descriptive Naming

Name files with date and description:

**Good naming:**
- `2026-01-15_office-supply-receipt_Staples_$45.pdf`
- `2026-03-20_professional-liability-insurance_HPSO_$1500.pdf`
- `2026-06-15_estimated-tax-payment_quarterly-2.pdf`

**Poor naming:**
- `receipt.pdf`
- `insurance.pdf`
- `2026_expenses`

Descriptive names make searching easy and clarify the document purpose.

## Tax & Accounting Records

### Maintain Year-Round

**Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments:**
- Keep confirmation of each quarterly payment (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- Document: Date paid, amount, method (IRS Direct Pay, bank ACH, check), confirmation number
- Store in: `Tax & Accounting/Estimated Quarterly Payments/`

**Business Income Documentation:**
- 1099s from insurance companies and other payers (received by January 31)
- Records of cash/check payments from clients (if not using EHR that tracks)
- Bank deposits showing therapy income
- Store in: `Tax & Accounting/Income Documentation/`

**Year-End Tax Files:**
- 1040-ES (estimated tax worksheet for following year)
- Copies of quarterly estimated payment confirmations
- 1099s received
- Business expense summary (created from your receipt records)
- Store in: `Tax & Accounting/Year-End Tax Files/`

### For Your CPA

By January 31 each year, provide your CPA:
1. Summary of income (from 1099s and client payments)
2. Summary of expenses by category (use your receipt records)
3. All business-related receipts and documentation
4. Home office information (if claiming deduction)
5. Vehicle mileage log (if claiming business vehicle)

Your CPA uses these to prepare:
- Form 1040 (federal individual return)
- Schedule C (self-employed income)
- Schedule SE (self-employment tax calculation)
- Any state returns needed

## Digital Backup Strategy

### Backup Your Records

Your business records are critical. Don't rely on a single copy.

**Recommended backup strategy:**
1. **Primary storage:** Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, iCloud)
   - Automatic syncing means changes are backed up immediately
   - Accessible from anywhere
   - Example: `Google Drive > My Drive > Business Records 2026`

2. **Secondary backup:** External hard drive (monthly backup)
   - Connect external drive monthly
   - Copy entire Business Records folder to external drive
   - Store external drive in safe location (home safe, safety deposit box)

3. **Third backup (optional):** Accountant's copy
   - Provide copies of year-end records to CPA
   - They store a copy on their secure servers
   - Creates third backup in case of disaster

### Retention Schedule

| Record Type | Retention Period | After Retention |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Tax returns and supporting docs | 7 years | Archive in cold storage |
| Business expense receipts | 7 years | Can discard |
| License certificates | Indefinite | Keep as proof of credentials |
| CE certificates | 2-year cycle minimum; 7 years recommended | Archive after license renewal |
| Business bank statements | 7 years | Archive |
| Insurance policies | Life of policy + 3 years | Archive after expiration |

### Digital File Tips

- **Encrypt sensitive files** (tax returns, financial statements)
- **Use cloud storage with two-factor authentication** (prevent unauthorized access)
- **Don't store tax ID or full account numbers in filenames** (privacy protection)
- **Regular backups:** Set automatic backup to external drive monthly
- **Document your backup location:** Keep a note of where backups are stored (in case you need to find them)

## Expense Tracking Throughout the Year

### Monthly Review

Once a month (recommended on the same day each month):
1. Download business bank and credit card statements
2. Review each transaction
3. Categorize transaction (office supplies, insurance, software, travel, etc.)
4. Ensure categorization is correct
5. Reconcile against actual receipts (confirm receipt matches statement)

**Tool options:**
- Spreadsheet (Excel, Google Sheets) - free, customizable
- Accounting software (QuickBooks, FreshBooks, Wave) - more automated
- EHR software (SimplePractice, TherapyNotes) - integrates billing and expenses

### Quarterly Review

Quarterly (roughly every 3 months):
1. Review expense summary by category (total spent in each category)
2. Compare against estimates from your tax planning
3. Check if you're on track for estimated tax payments
4. Identify any under-deducted categories
5. Plan remaining-year spending

### Year-End Process

**By December 31:**
1. Reconcile all bank and credit card statements through December
2. Review all receipts; ensure categorization is complete
3. Calculate total expenses by category
4. Confirm all CE hours are documented (for license renewal)
5. Gather license renewal documents if renewal is upcoming

**By January 31:**
1. Compile full list of income and expenses
2. Organize all receipts and documents by category
3. Prepare summary document for CPA
4. Provide copies of 1099s received

**By February 15:**
1. Submit organized records to CPA
2. CPA prepares tax return

**By April 15:**
1. Review final return with CPA
2. File return
3. Pay any remaining tax liability

## Common Organization Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Mixing Personal and Business Receipts

**Problem:** Storing personal and business receipts together; difficult to find business receipts; risk deducting personal items

**Solution:** Maintain separate receipt folders (or use separate credit card for business)

### Mistake 2: Not Documenting Business Purpose

**Problem:** Keeps receipt but forgets why it was a business expense (especially for meals/travel); harder to defend in audit

**Solution:** Add note to receipt or document business purpose in file name

**Example:**
- `Bad:` `2026-05-20_receipt_$45.pdf`
- `Good:` `2026-05-20_business-meal_referral-source-meeting_$45.pdf`

### Mistake 3: Losing CE Certificates

**Problem:** Takes CE course, loses certificate; can't prove completion at renewal time

**Solution:** Scan or photograph certificate immediately after course; store in CE subfolder with course name and date

### Mistake 4: Waiting Until Tax Time to Organize

**Problem:** April rolls around, all receipts are loose or in random folders; CPA spends hours organizing; you pay higher fees

**Solution:** Organize monthly; spend 1 hour/month to categorize receipts and transactions

### Mistake 5: Not Backing Up Digital Records

**Problem:** Computer crashes; years of records lost; no backup

**Solution:** Use cloud storage (automatic backup) + monthly external hard drive backup

## Quick Start Checklist

To organize your records right now:

- [ ] Create folder structure (on computer or cloud storage) based on template above
- [ ] Scan or photograph all physical receipts from current year
- [ ] Organize scanned files into appropriate categories
- [ ] Document current year's CE courses and certificates
- [ ] Print/save your current license certificates
- [ ] Create compliance calendar document with your renewal deadlines
- [ ] Set up monthly reminder to review and categorize expenses
- [ ] Set up backup routine (cloud storage + external hard drive)
- [ ] Shred or recycle old receipts (after 7+ years retention)

Starting with good organization now prevents scrambling at tax time later.
