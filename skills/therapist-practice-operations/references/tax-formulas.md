# Tax Formulas for Therapist Sole Proprietors

## Self-Employment Tax Calculation

Self-employed individuals pay both the employer and employee portions of Social Security and Medicare taxes. As a therapist, calculate as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate Net Profit
```
Gross Therapy Income
- Business Expenses (deductible items)
= Net Profit from Self-Employment
```

### Step 2: Apply Self-Employment Tax
Self-employment tax applies to approximately 92.35% of net profit (the employer portion is deductible).

```
Net Profit × 0.9235 × 0.153 = Self-Employment Tax Liability

Where:
  0.9235 = adjustment factor (92.35% of net profit is subject to SE tax)
  0.153 = 15.3% tax rate (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare)
```

### Step 3: Calculate Income Tax Liability
After self-employment tax, calculate federal income tax. Use current year tax brackets (rates change annually).

```
(Net Profit + 0.5 × Self-Employment Tax) = Adjusted Gross Income
Adjusted Gross Income - Standard Deduction - Eligible Deductions = Taxable Income
Taxable Income × Tax Bracket = Income Tax Liability
```

Note: You can deduct half your self-employment tax from income before calculating income tax.

### Example: Annual Tax Calculation

**Scenario:** Therapist with $85,000 gross income, $12,000 in deductible expenses

```
Step 1: Net Profit
$85,000 - $12,000 = $73,000

Step 2: Self-Employment Tax
$73,000 × 0.9235 × 0.153 = $10,340

Step 3: Deductible Portion of SE Tax
$10,340 × 0.5 = $5,170

Step 4: Adjusted Gross Income
$73,000 - $5,170 = $67,830

Step 5: Taxable Income (using 2026 single filer standard deduction ~$14,600)
$67,830 - $14,600 = $53,230

Step 6: Income Tax (using 2026 brackets, rough estimate for 22% bracket)
$53,230 × 0.22 = $11,711

Total Tax Liability: $10,340 (SE tax) + $11,711 (income tax) = $22,051
```

## Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments

### Payment Due Dates

- **Q1 (January 1 - March 31)**: Due April 15
- **Q2 (April 1 - May 31)**: Due June 15
- **Q3 (June 1 - August 31)**: Due September 15
- **Q4 (September 1 - December 31)**: Due January 15 (next year)

### Calculating Quarterly Payments

**Method 1: Four Equal Installments (Simplest)**

```
Annual Tax Liability ÷ 4 = Quarterly Payment

Example: $22,051 ÷ 4 = $5,513 per quarter
```

**Method 2: Actual Income Tracking (Adjusts throughout year)**

```
Year-to-Date Actual Income × Tax Rate = Year-to-Date Tax Liability
Year-to-Date Tax Liability ÷ Quarters Elapsed = Quarterly Payment

Adjust each quarter based on actual income received.
```

### Safe Harbor Rules (Avoid Penalties)

You avoid penalties if your total quarterly payments equal at least:
- **100% of prior year tax liability**, OR
- **90% of current year tax liability**, OR
- **110% of prior year tax liability** (for high earners: >$150,000 AGI)

### Example: Quarterly Adjustment

**Year 1:** Estimated $85,000 income → $22,051 annual tax → $5,513/quarter

**Quarter 2 check:** Actual income through June = $45,000 (higher than expected)
```
Projected annual income: $45,000 × 2 = $90,000 (likely higher than estimate)
Revised annual tax estimate: ~$24,000
Remaining quarterly payments (Q2, Q3, Q4): $24,000 - $5,513 = $18,487 ÷ 3 = $6,162/quarter
```

Adjust Q2 and beyond upward to $6,162 to avoid penalties.

## Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction

### 20% Deduction (Section 199A)

Eligible self-employed therapists may deduct up to 20% of Qualified Business Income. This is NOT a self-employment tax deduction—it reduces your taxable income.

```
Net Business Income × 20% = QBI Deduction (limited by other factors)
```

### Example: QBI Deduction Impact

Using the therapist example above:

```
Net Profit: $73,000
QBI Deduction (tentative): $73,000 × 20% = $14,600

Taxable Income Recalculation:
$67,830 (AGI) - $14,600 (standard deduction) - $14,600 (QBI) = $38,630

New Income Tax: $38,630 × 0.22 = $8,499 (vs. $11,711 without QBI)

Tax Savings: $11,711 - $8,499 = $3,212
```

### QBI Limitations for Therapists

**Important:** Therapists are typically classified as a "Specified Service Trade or Business" (SSTB) because their practice involves the performance of services in the health field.

For SSTB businesses:
- If your taxable income (before QBI deduction) exceeds thresholds (~$182,100 for single, ~$364,200 for married filing jointly in 2026), the QBI deduction becomes limited
- Even below thresholds, additional limitations may apply

### Check Your SSTB Status

Therapist practices are generally SSTB because:
- Services are in the health or therapy field
- Customer/patient relationships are key to the business

Verify your specific credential and state to confirm. If uncertain, consult a CPA.

## Home Office Deduction

If you maintain a dedicated therapy office in your home, you can deduct expenses.

### Method 1: Simplified Method (Easier)

```
Dedicated Office Square Footage × $5 = Annual Deduction

Example: 120 sq ft office × $5 = $600/year

Maximum: $1,500/year (300 sq ft)
```

### Method 2: Actual Expense Method (More Complex but Higher Deduction)

```
Home Office % = Office Square Footage ÷ Total Home Square Footage

Home Office % × (Mortgage Interest or Rent, Utilities, Repairs, Depreciation)
= Home Office Deduction

Example:
Office: 150 sq ft
Total home: 2,000 sq ft
Office %: 150 ÷ 2,000 = 7.5%

Monthly mortgage interest: $1,000
Monthly utilities: $200
Monthly repairs/maintenance: $150

Monthly home office deduction: ($1,000 + $200 + $150) × 7.5% = $101.25
Annual: $101.25 × 12 = $1,215
```

Actual expense method often yields higher deductions but requires detailed records.

## Malpractice Insurance Premium Deduction

100% of malpractice/professional liability insurance premiums are deductible as a business expense.

```
Annual Malpractice Insurance Premium = Deductible Expense
```

Example: $1,500/year malpractice insurance = $1,500 deduction

## Continuing Education Deduction

Course fees, materials, travel, and meals during CE activities are deductible.

```
CE Deductions Include:
- Course/conference registration fees
- Required textbooks and materials
- Travel (airfare, hotel, meals) for out-of-state CE
- Licensing exam fees
- Professional association dues
```

Example: Attend 2-day conference in another state
```
Conference registration: $300
Hotel (2 nights): $200
Meals during conference: $100
Travel: $150
= $750 deductible CE expense
```

## Record Retention Guidelines

Maintain tax records for **7 years** to be safe, though the IRS typically audits within 3-6 years for therapists.

Keep:
- Quarterly estimated payment confirmations
- 1099s from insurance companies and clients
- Complete expense receipts and records
- Mileage logs (if claiming travel deduction)
- Home office documentation (if using actual expense method)
- CE course confirmations

## State Income Tax Considerations

Most states tax sole proprietor income. Some states have no income tax.

### Examples:

**Washington:** No state income tax on business income (only capital gains tax)
**Florida:** No state income tax at all

If you practice in both states but live in one, you may owe income tax to both states for therapy income earned in that state.

Consult `references/state-requirements.md` for tax implications in your specific state(s).

## Common Deduction Errors

### Over-Deducting
Claiming personal items (portion of home utilities/rent not dedicated to office, personal vehicle expenses, family meals) creates audit risk.

**Rule:** Only deduct items directly related to your therapy business. When in doubt, consult a CPA.

### Under-Deducting
Missing legitimate deductions reduces your bottom line unnecessarily.

**Likely missed deductions:**
- Professional association dues (APA, state licensing board, specialty associations)
- Licensing exam and renewal fees
- Subscriptions to therapy journals/resources
- Office supplies and equipment under $2,500
- Professional development books and training

### Mixing Personal and Business
Using a personal account for both business and personal expenses makes deduction tracking difficult and creates audit risk.

**Best practice:** Maintain a separate business checking account and credit card. Categorize transactions immediately.
