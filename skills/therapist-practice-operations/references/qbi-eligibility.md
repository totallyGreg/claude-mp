# QBI Deduction Eligibility for Therapists

This reference explains the Qualified Business Income (Section 199A) deduction and how it applies to mental health therapists.

## Overview of QBI Deduction

### What is QBI?

The Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction, established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, allows eligible self-employed individuals to deduct up to 20% of their business income from their taxable income. This is a separate deduction from standard business expenses and self-employment tax deductions.

### Basic Calculation

```
Net Business Income × 20% = QBI Deduction

Example:
Net Income: $80,000
QBI Deduction: $80,000 × 20% = $16,000

Taxable Income Reduction: $16,000
Tax Savings: $16,000 × your tax bracket (e.g., 22%) = $3,520
```

### Expiration and Changes

- **Current Status:** The QBI deduction is scheduled to expire after December 31, 2025 unless Congress extends it
- **Action:** Monitor tax law changes; if extended, rules may change
- **Consult:** Work with a CPA to understand any changes when filing 2026 taxes

## Therapist Classification: SSTB (Specified Service Trade or Business)

### Key Issue for Therapists

Mental health therapists are classified as providing a **Specified Service Trade or Business (SSTB)** because:
- Services are in the health field
- Success depends on client/patient relationships
- Services involve the performance of work in healthcare

This classification creates limitations on the QBI deduction.

### What is SSTB?

SSTB includes:
- Health, medical, dental professions
- Services where success depends on customer/client relationships (counseling, therapy, coaching)
- Consulting services
- Financial services
- Investment services

**Therapists fall into SSTB** because therapy services depend on the therapeutic relationship with clients.

### SSTB Impact: Income Limitations

The QBI deduction for SSTB businesses is **limited by income thresholds:**

#### 2026 Income Thresholds (Subject to Change)

- **Single filers:** Threshold is approximately $182,100
- **Married filing jointly:** Threshold is approximately $364,200

#### How the Limitation Works

**If your taxable income is BELOW the threshold:**
- You can take the full 20% QBI deduction without SSTB limitations
- Example: $80,000 income → full $16,000 QBI deduction allowed

**If your taxable income is ABOVE the threshold:**
- SSTB limitations apply; your deduction may be reduced
- The deduction is limited to the greater of:
  1. 20% of QBI, OR
  2. The lesser of:
     - 20% of QBI, OR
     - 20% of W2 wages paid + 2.5% of unadjusted basis of qualified property

**In English:** If you exceed the threshold and don't have W2 employees or depreciable business property, your deduction may be eliminated or significantly reduced.

### Example: SSTB Limitation

**Scenario:** Therapist with $200,000 taxable income (above $182,100 threshold for single filer)

Because this is SSTB and income exceeds the threshold:
- **20% of QBI:** $200,000 × 20% = $40,000 (this would be the deduction without limitation)
- **W2 wages:** $0 (no employees)
- **Qualified property:** $0 (office equipment is depreciable, but doesn't count as "qualified property" for this calculation)
- **Limitation calculation:** Greater of 20% of QBI OR (20% of W2 wages + 2.5% of property basis)
- **Result:** $0 (no W2 wages, no qualified property)
- **QBI deduction allowed:** $0 (even though business income is $200,000)

This shows that high-earning therapists may not benefit from QBI deduction if they don't have W2-eligible employees.

### Exception: SSTB Limitation Relief

You may be able to avoid SSTB limitations if you:
- Don't meet the definition of SSTB for your specific business (unlikely for therapists)
- Have W2-eligible employees (who work for your therapy practice)
- Have significant depreciable qualified property

Most solo therapists cannot claim QBI deduction if income exceeds thresholds due to SSTB limitations.

## Strategies to Maximize QBI Benefit (if eligible)

### Strategy 1: Maximize Deductions (Increase Net Income Below Threshold)

Higher business deductions = higher QBI deduction.

```
Gross Income: $150,000
Deductions: $30,000 (office, CE, insurance, supplies, etc.)
Net Income: $120,000
QBI Deduction (if below threshold): $120,000 × 20% = $24,000
```

Focus on deducting all legitimate business expenses:
- Professional liability insurance
- Continuing education
- Professional association dues
- Office equipment and supplies
- Business services (CPA, attorney)
- Technology and software
- Home office (if applicable)

See `references/expense-categories.md` for comprehensive deduction list.

### Strategy 2: Keep Income Below Threshold (if possible)

If you're approaching the threshold, consider:
- Spreading clients between multiple therapists (employ other therapists → creates W2 wages → can affect QBI calculation)
- Deferring income to future years (if possible)
- Structuring as S-Corp (more complex; consult CPA)

**Note:** For most therapists, operating as a sole proprietor is simpler than S-Corp.

### Strategy 3: Hire W2 Employees

If you supervise other therapists or have employees, they create W2 wages that can increase QBI deduction capacity for SSTB businesses.

```
Example with W2 employees:
Net QBI: $250,000 (above $182,100 threshold, so SSTB limitation applies)
W2 wages paid to other therapists: $60,000
Qualified property basis: $0

SSTB limitation calculation:
Greater of:
1. 20% of QBI = $250,000 × 20% = $50,000, OR
2. Lesser of:
   a. 20% of QBI = $50,000, OR
   b. (20% of W2 wages) + (2.5% of property) = (20% × $60,000) + $0 = $12,000

Result: Greater of $50,000 OR $12,000 = $50,000
QBI deduction: $50,000 (higher than without W2 employees)
```

Hiring therapists increases both your business complexity and your QBI deduction capacity.

### Strategy 4: Business Structure Considerations

**Sole Proprietor vs. S-Corp:**

**Sole Proprietor (most common for therapists):**
- Simplest tax filing (Schedule C on 1040)
- Subject to full self-employment tax
- Subject to SSTB limitations on QBI
- Generally: No advantage to S-Corp treatment

**S-Corporation (more complex):**
- Separate business tax return (Form 1120-S)
- May reduce self-employment tax (pay reasonable salary, distribute remainder as dividends)
- Can still subject to SSTB limitations
- Additional complexity and accounting costs

**For most therapists:** Sole proprietor is simpler and tax-efficient. Only consider S-Corp if you have significant employees and want to optimize self-employment tax.

Consult a CPA before switching business structures.

## QBI Deduction Calculation Worksheet

### Step 1: Determine Your Business Income

```
Gross Therapy Income: $__________
- Business Deductions: $__________
= Net Business Income (QBI): $__________
```

### Step 2: Check Income Threshold

```
Your Taxable Income: $__________

Single filer threshold (2026): ~$182,100
Married filing jointly threshold (2026): ~$364,200

[ ] Income is BELOW threshold → Proceed to Step 3 (full deduction possible)
[ ] Income is ABOVE threshold → Consult CPA (SSTB limitations apply)
```

### Step 3: Calculate 20% QBI Deduction

```
Net Business Income (from Step 1): $__________
× 20%
= Potential QBI Deduction: $__________

(This is subject to other limitations; consult CPA if income exceeds threshold or if you have W2 employees/property)
```

### Step 4: Tax Savings

```
Potential QBI Deduction: $__________
× Your Marginal Tax Bracket: ______% (typically 12%, 22%, 24%, or 32%)
= Estimated Tax Savings: $__________
```

## Important Disclaimers

1. **Tax law changes:** QBI deduction expires after 2025 unless extended; rules may change
2. **SSTB determination:** Therapist classification as SSTB is complex; verify with CPA
3. **Income thresholds:** Thresholds change annually and are indexed for inflation
4. **Calculation complexity:** If income exceeds thresholds, full calculation is complex; consult CPA
5. **W2 wage rules:** Rules around qualified wages and property are technical; consult CPA if applicable
6. **Professional advice:** This is educational information, not tax advice. Work with a CPA for your specific situation.

## Action Items

- [ ] Confirm current QBI expiration date (currently December 31, 2025, but may be extended)
- [ ] Estimate 2026 taxable income to determine if you'll be above or below income threshold
- [ ] Maximize deductions throughout the year (see `references/expense-categories.md`)
- [ ] If approaching income threshold, discuss QBI impact with CPA
- [ ] If considering hiring employees, understand QBI wage calculation implications
- [ ] When filing 2026 taxes, work with CPA to calculate QBI deduction (or determine if SSTB limitation eliminates it)
