## Record Organization Best Practices

### Maintain Throughout the Year
1. **Separate business account:** Use dedicated business checking account and credit card
2. **Immediate categorization:** Label all transactions by expense category when they occur
3. **Receipt storage:** Keep digital copies (photos) or originals for all purchases
4. **Monthly review:** Reconcile account monthly and ensure categorization is correct
5. **Annual archive:** Save year-end records in organized folder structure

### Folder Structure Example
```
2026 Tax Records/
├── Office Supplies (receipts)
├── Professional Liability Insurance (policy + invoices)
├── CE & Professional Development (course receipts)
├── Professional Dues (membership confirmations)
├── Software & Technology (subscription receipts)
├── Travel (airfare, hotel, meal receipts)
├── Business Services (CPA, attorney invoices)
├── Home Office (measurements, utility bills)
└── Other (miscellaneous receipts)
```

### Retention
- **Keep records for 7 years minimum** (IRS audits within 3-6 years typically)
- **Digital backup:** Store digital copies in cloud storage for redundancy

## Deduction Tracking Summary

Use `examples/expense-tracker.csv` to log deductions throughout the year.

Total deductions typically range from **$8,000 to $20,000+ per year** depending on whether you have an office space, extent of travel, and CE participation.

Higher deductions reduce your taxable income, directly reducing your income tax liability. See `references/tax-formulas.md` for how deductions impact your tax calculation.
