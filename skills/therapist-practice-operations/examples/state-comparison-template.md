### Multi-State Practice Considerations

**If Operating in Both States:**

**Advantages:**
- Expanded client base (serve patients in both states)
- Professional development exposure to both state boards
- Flexibility to relocate while maintaining license

**Challenges:**
- Two separate renewal cycles (different deadlines)
- Two sets of CE requirements (40 hours total over 2 years)
- Higher total licensing costs (~$525/2 years)
- Duplicate documentation and record-keeping

**Strategy for Multi-State Therapists:**
1. Stagger renewal dates (example: WA in Jan, FL in Oct) to avoid simultaneous renewals
2. Use unified CE tracker (mark which courses apply to which state)
3. Maintain state-specific renewal calendars and reminders
4. Keep separate folders for each state's renewal documents
5. Budget extra time for CE completion (40 hours per 2-year cycle)
